          How Do We Use "Cookies"?

          Visitors should be aware that non-personal information and data may be
          automatically collected by BRAC’s Website through the use of
          "cookies." "Cookies" are small text files a Website can use to
          recognise repeat visitors, facilitate the visitor’s ongoing access to
          and use of the site, and allow a site to track usage behavior and
          compile aggregate data that will allow content improvements. Cookies
          are not programmes that come onto a visitor’s system and damage files.
          Generally, cookies work by assigning a unique number to the visitor
          that has no meaning outside the assigning site. If a visitor does not
          want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a
          simple procedure in most browsers that allows the visitor to deny or
          accept the cookie feature. BRAC uses "cookie" technology only to
          obtain non-personal information from its online visitors in order to
          improve visitors’ online experience and facilitate their visit within
          our site.

          Welcomes children to learn more about our organisation and about the
          issues presented on the BRAC sites, and we are particularly respectful
          of the privacy of our young users. We encourage parents to monitor
          their children's use of the Internet and to help us protect their
          privacy by instructing them never to provide personal information on
          this site or any other without permission. We will never attempt to
          extract unnecessary information from our users, regardless of age.
          Consistent with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998
          ("COPPA"), we will never knowingly request personally identifiable
          information from anyone under the age of 13 without prior verifiable
          parental consent. If we become aware that a child under 13 has
          provided us with such information without consent, we will use our
          best efforts to remove such information from our files. If a parent or
          guardian becomes aware that a child under 13 has provided such
          information to us, he or she should contact
